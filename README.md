# Linux Shell Scripting

It is the first basic step to anyone who wants to enter the field of *DevOps*.

I introduced different concepts and will constantly update this repo.

You can fork, pull or clone the repo if you want a resources that is easy to understand.

**Please Note the following must be done**

1.  #!/bin/bash  (As seen in the shell script file, is what tells your system the interpreter to use).
2.  You must use this code on your terminal before your script works.
    
    which bash (enables you see the location of your interpreter - /bin/bash)
    
    chmod +x *file name.sh* ( allows executable permission)
    
    ./filename.sh
    



Happy Learning..........
